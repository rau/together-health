# TogetherHealth

## Purpose

The overarching purpose of our website is to allow users to register and login an account which allows them to submit information forms about themselves. First, we have three databases involved in our project.

## Objectives:

These objectives

- Let users register and login to the site.
- Allow them to specify their healthcare needs.
- Recommend and show them plans that most closely align with their needs.

## Design Considerations:

We wanted the website to be concise in its function. We have a home page, which contains a FAQ section. We have an about us section describing the background and interests of the founders and developers of the website. We have login and registration pages for users to create the accounts. However, the service is largely provided through the form submission and the plan page which is where the user submits his information and receives an appropriate health insurance plan according to our website.

### Website Architecture (Raunak)



Blueprints and Flask

### The Login/Register Pages (Raunak and Saketh)
The schema of the database primarily involved with the login/registration functionality of the website is as follows
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    "id" INTEGER UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "username" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "password_hash" TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```
During registration, the user is prompted to enter a name, username, and a password. When the registration is submitted, a SQL query is made and we verify if the account does not exist, the password is valid, and username is unique. We would store a unique user_id for the user, the submitted name, the submitted username, and the submitted password stored after being hashed.

During login, a SQL query is made to verify if the username and password matches any existing profile, and then allows the user to login.

### The Information Form Submission (Khoi)
The form submission page prompts the user several questions which would be recorded and stored into the database. Particularly, there are five questions asking the user to prompt a certain boolean condition. Additionally, there are three more questions prompting the user for an integer input. This information is then passed onto the database and stored as appropriate to the user_id as well as calls the algorithm (see below for algorithm documentation). The SQL query is made to the following schema
```
CREATE TABLE preferences (
    "user_id" INTEGER UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    "married" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "dependents" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    "tobacco" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, 
    "preexisting" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, 
    "dental" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "travel" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "monthly_budget_high" INTEGER DEFAULT 3000,
    "copay_high" INTEGER DEFAULT 3000
)
```
user_id refers to the particular user submitting the form. married refers to the married status of the user. dependents refers to the number of dependents of the user. tobacco refers to whether or not the user smokes. preexisting refers to the pre-existing conditions status of the user. dental refers to if the user wants dental coverage. travel refers to if the user wants out of area coverage. monthly_budget_high refers to the maximum value per month the user would like to spend on the health insurance premium. copay_high refers to the highest value the user would like to spend on the copay.

### Letting Users See Their Matches (Khoi)
Users can see the list of matching plans on the plans page. Here, the algorithm recommends the best plans and the page queries for the plans and their attributes. We then list the plans and plans' attribute information into a table. The schema of the plans database is described by the following table
```
CREATE TABLE plans (
    "plan_id" INTEGER UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    "out_of_area" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "tobacco" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "disease" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "dental" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "copay" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "individual" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "couple" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "dependent" INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```
plan_id refers to a particular plan. out_of_area refers to if the plan offers out of area coverage. tobacco refers to if the plan covers smokers. disease refers to if the plan covers users with pre-existing conditions. dental refers to if dental coverage is offered. copay refers the cost of the copay with the health insurance plan. individual refers to the base rate for an unmarried individual under the given plan. couple refers to the abse rate for a couple under a given insurance plan. dependent refers cost per dependent added to the plan. These aspects are all essential to the pricing and function of health insurance plans.

### The Sample Data (Saketh and Khoi)

The sample data was constructed using the information detailed in [this PDF](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/Downloads/HIOS-RBIS-ICD-03-01-00.pdf), which contains information on the type of data that healthcare plans often hold. In order to simplify the data, we created dummy data based on the information contained in the PDF. 

The sample data is structured as it is in order to accurately represent the 

The schema for the the database is as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE plans (
    "plan_id" INTEGER UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    "out_of_area" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "tobacco" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "disease" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "dental" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "copay" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "individual" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "couple" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "dependent" INTEGER NOT NULL
)
                
CREATE TABLE preferences (
    "user_id" INTEGER UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    "married" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "dependents" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    "tobacco" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, 
    "preexisting" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, 
    "dental" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "travel" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    "monthly_budget_high" INTEGER DEFAULT 3000,
    "copay_high" INTEGER DEFAULT 3000
)
```

NOTE: We had trouble finding where we could put the populate data function, so we put it in a hidden link and commented out. In form.py, the index() function has the table_setup function which is commented out. If the data is lost, this function can repopulate the tables.

### The Algorithm (Saketh)

The algorithm essentially decomposes the users' data into 3 axes; their needs for copay (which is a function of their expected risk), the risk taken by the insurance carrier (some people may need a dental plan, or coverage for other conditions like diseases or smoking), and the monthly premium (affordability). It maps the data into a space, where it then calculates the length of three normalized vecotrs and sums them; the norm of this vecotr is the"distance" between a patient and a plan; the smaller this distance, the better.

We chose this algorithm because it is applicable to many other applications (such as roommate matching) and will help us with the future development of this app, as real healthcare plans may have factors that add more axes or complicated calculations to the graph.
